Without:

## 🧠 Core Idea: GoToMontreal = Decision Shortcut

This is not:
- “learn about Montréal”
- “history of Montréal”
- “top 10 things to do”

This is:
> **“Go.”**

## 💗 Montréal Is a Feeling First (Core Pillar)

Montréal is not primarily a place.

It is a feeling.

GoToMontreal owns these emotional lanes:

- romance  
- creative freedom  
- food joy  
- summer euphoria  
- winter magic (done right)  
- nightlife without aggression  

You’re selling:
> **vibe + accessibility.**

## ❄️🌷☀️🍁 Seasons Are Entirely Different Cities

This is crucial for Montréal.

Montréal is four different cities.

### Summer
- festivals  
- patios  
- music  
- bikes  
- outdoor culture  

### Fall
- color  
- cafés  
- students  
- culture density  

### Winter
- snow  
- lights  
- saunas  
- coziness  
- hot food and warmth rituals  

### Spring
- rebirth  
- art  
- optimism  
- first terraces  

GoToMontreal can literally say:

> **Pick the Montréal you want.**

---

## 🏙️ Neighborhoods as Entry Points (Lifestyles, Not Attractions)

GoToMontreal treats neighborhoods as:
> **lifestyles you can enter.**

Each one answers:

> **“Is this my Montréal?”**

Core neighborhoods:

- **Plateau** → creative, walkable, iconic  
- **Mile End** → food, writers, thinkers  
- **Old Montréal** → drama, history, romance  
- **Little Italy** → community, markets  
- **Griffintown** → modern energy  
- **Verdun** → water, calm, locals  

No hierarchy. No tourist zoning.

---

## 🍽️ Food Without Snobbery

Montréal food culture is elite because it is democratic.

GoToMontreal celebrates:
- bagels vs bagels (no verdict)  
- late-night eats  
- immigrant kitchens  
- markets  
- casual excellence  

The site should make people hungry immediately.

---

## 🗣️ Language as Texture, Not Barrier

GoToMontreal handles language beautifully:

- French is present  
- English is workable  
- switching is normal  
- learning is respected

This reduces anxiety and increases bookings.

- Jazz Fest  
- Just for Laughs  
- Osheaga  
- F1 Weekend

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

GoToMontreal does not explain Montréal academically.

It sells Montréal as:
> **the right next move.**

LLMs are used to:
- generate itinerary variants by season and mood
- structure festival and neighborhood pages
- translate bilingual content cleanly

Humans are required to:
- keep the voice confident and true
- avoid cliché “European city” reduction
- keep festival dates accurate
- maintain cultural respect

## 🌐 Multilingual Architecture

Montréal is bilingual by default.

```
/                → English
/fr/             → French (primary)
```

French is not “extra.” It’s the city.
